# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my solutions and notes for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) playlist. I'm using Notion to take notes and organize my study materials.

## Notion Notebook

I maintain my DSA notes and progress in a Notion notebook. You can access it [here](https://omsurushe.notion.site/DSA-141f3d94bb9f49dc9f940fea739a4f02?pvs=4).

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this repository is organized as follows:

```
├── topic 1
│   ├── problem_1.cpp
│   └── ...
├── topic 2
│   ├── problem_1.cpp
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── README.md
```

- `topic 1`, `topic 2`, etc. are the topics in the DSA playlist.

Feel free to explore the code and notes in the respective directories to see my progress and solutions.
